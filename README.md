## 📝 Example File Format

For batch uploads, structure your file with the following required columns:

**Required columns by file type:**

- **Excel files**: `Registration number` (or `Registration`)
- **CSV files**: `Attended` and `Professional council number`

### 📁 Test Files

Sample files are provided in the `docs/` folder for testing:

- `docs/81117837665_attendee_report.csv` - Zoom attendee report example
- `docs/*.xlsx` - Excel spreadsheet examples

You can upload these files directly to test the batch upload functionality.

**Excel (.xlsx, .xls) example:**

| Registration number | Name | Surname |
| ------------------- | ---- | ------- |
| MP0518891           | John | Smith   |
| DR1234567           | Jane | Doe     |
| DR7654321           | Bob  | Wilson  |

**CSV (.csv) example** (e.g., Zoom attendee reports):

| Attended | User Name (Original Name) | First Name | Last Name | Email            | Professional council name | Professional council number | ... |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- | --- |
| Yes      | John Smith                | John       | Smith     | john@example.com | HPCSA                     | MP0518891                   | ... |
| No       | Jane Doe                  | Jane       | Doe       | jane@example.com | HPCSA                     | DR1234567                   | ... |
| Yes      | Bob Wilson                | Bob        | Wilson    | bob@example.com  | SANC                      | 15805344                    | ... |

**Supported formats:**

- Excel: `.xlsx`, `.xls`
- CSV: `.csv` (UTF-8 encoded)

**Notes:**

- Excel files: All rows are processed using the `Registration number` field
- CSV files: Only rows where `Attended` = "Yes" are processed using the `Professional council number` field
- CSV files with metadata headers (like Zoom reports) are automatically handled - only rows with valid `Attended` and `Professional council number` values are processed
- Rows with missing registration numbers or empty `Attended` values are automatically skipped
